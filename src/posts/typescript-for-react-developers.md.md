TypeScript brings type safety to your React applications, helping you catch errors early and improve code quality.

## Benefits

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time.
- **Better Tooling**: Enhanced autocompletion and refactoring.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Clearer code with type annotations.

## Example

```tsx
interface Props {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const UserCard: React.FC<Props> = ({ name, age }) => (
  <div>
    <h2>{name}</h2>
    <p>Age: {age}</p>
  </div>
);
```
